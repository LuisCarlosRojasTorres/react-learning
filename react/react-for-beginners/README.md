##  Introduction

- When a `html` is loaded the broser thakes that file and creates a tree like structura called `Document Object Model` or `DOM`.
  - This permits to use `js` and change the page content.
    - `Vanilla js`: plain `js` no third-party.
- With `react` there is no worry about quering and updating `DOM` elements. A page can be created using small reusable components and `react` will create and update `DOM` elements.
  - `Components`: help tp create reusable, modular, and better organized code.
    - It can be developed individually and them combine them to build a page.
    - A `react` application is a tree of components with the `app` being the `root` bringing everything together.
